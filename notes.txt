// notes for game engine development

1. key event stashing
    figure out a way to stash key events such that they are carried out on the next available loop.
    hopefully this will make multiple key-presses possible.
    this is the same logic that i'm going to be using for server cloning
2. server cloning
    if entity is to be server-cloned, all statuses for that entity are stored in stash each loop
    when the server-contact periodic event is ran, it sends the entity statuses via ajax post to the server API.
    if entity is from server, its statuses are set by the ajax returned
3. levels
    i think this is going to be basically a new rewriting of the game engine...
    i'm going to need a 'level' object and then add entities to those levels.
    engine will run the '0' level first, which should always be the menu
    activeLevel variable, so i don't have to loop through every level
    i think events should be set to individual levels too for 
        different ai behavior
        different motion behavior
        level-specific occurrences
4. map movement
    all entities for the level should be anchored to the level origin
    if an entity is static, the level moves, and the entity moves to stay centered
    if the level is static, the entity moves
5. map rendering
    if an enitity is off-screen and is set to only be rendered on screen, it should not be rendered
    rendering will only occur for these entities if the gamespace and the entity overlap
6. entity movement
    each entity is assigned a separate motionBehavior
    ai receive an AI motionBehavior
    motionBehaviors are with respect to Level
    centered motionBehaviors come in centeredFull, centeredX, and centeredY
